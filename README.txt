DSVRandom (DSVania Randomizer) is a randomizer for the three Castlevania games for the Nintendo DS: Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia. Currently it's only compatible with the North American versions.

### Features

DSVRandom has options to randomize:
Items/Skills: Randomizes items and skills you find lying on the ground.
Enemy Locations: Randomizes which non-boss enemies appear where.
Enemy Drops: Randomizes the items, souls, and glyphs dropped by non-boss enemies, as well as their drop chances.
Boss Souls: Randomizes the souls dropped by bosses (DoS only).

There are also some buggy, experimental options:
Players: Randomizes player graphics and movement stats.
Boss Locations: Randomizes which bosses appear where.
Area Connections: Randomizes which areas connect to each other.
Room Connections: Randomizes which rooms within an area connect to each other.
Starting Room: Randomizes which room you start in.
Enemy AI: Shuffles the AI of non-boss enemies.

Every seed should be completable as long as you don't use the experimental options, though there may be bugs in the randomizer that make some seeds unwinnable.

### Requirements

The path where DSVRandom is located must only have ASCII characters in it - the program will not launch if there are any unicode characters in it.
